# CreateYourOwnAdventure
CreateYourOwnAdventure repo is a solution which allows a player to choose their own
adventure by picking from multiple choices in order to progress to the next set of choices,
until they get to one of the endings. You should be able to persist the playerâ€™s choices and in
the end, show the steps they took to get to the end of the game.

This application is built using .Net 6 and SQLite 3.12.2

- Add more validations
- More negative unit tests and improve code coverage 
- Add integration tests using SpecFlow
- Docker installation could be automated
